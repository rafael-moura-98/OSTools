## Infix to postfix

### toPostfix()

    It is a function created to convert infix expression to postfix. Infix expression looks like this: "a+b*c", and the same expression on postfix looks like this: "ab+c*". 

    **"Why?"** you might ask. The postfix output is easier to interpretate and solve the expression.
