# It is planned to be developed
Graphic User Interface where will be find a configuration tab to modify the default shotcuts and add personalized ones. A second tab will be 'help' where it will be found tips and steps to undestand how to use OSTools.

## Infix to postfix

### toPostfix()

It is a function created to convert infix expression to postfix. Infix expression looks like this: "a+b*c", and the same expression on postfix looks like this: "ab+c*". 

**"Why?"** you might ask. The postfix output is easier to interpretate and solve the expression because it orders the expression values from higher to lower (power, multiplication, division, addition and subtraction).

You can learn more about the infix to postfix convertion by watching the amazing video made by Jayanti Khatri Lamba on this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAceaOSnxQs&t=380s&ab_channel=Jenny%27slecturesCS%2FITNET%26JRF)
